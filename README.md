# yeetbot
This is my first discord bot and the first big Pytho=n Project that I have undertaken.
It is a simple bot with a few Utility and meme commands that I was expermenting with.
To run the bot you would have to create a .env with a Variable DISCORD_TOKEN that would be assigned your bot's discord token.
